# Alzheimer’s Disease Classification Using Global Filter Network (GFNet)

## Introduction
This project implements Alzheimer's disease classification using the ADNI dataset and Global Filter Network (GFNet) model.

### GFNet Model
GFNet is a Transformer based deep learning network and it incorporates desing elemtents from CNN, especially in its hierarchical model variant.

### Dataset 
In this project, we will use ADNI dataset obatined from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [^1]. This dataset contains two classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Normal Control (NC). Each class has separate folders for train and test sets. The distribution of the dataset is shown in the table below.

| Dataset | AD | NC |
|---------|----|----|
| Training set | 10400 | 11120 |
| Test set | 4460 | 4540 |

Some examples of the images from dataset is shown below.
